# naomi-news

This is the source for our naomi changelog, it will be deployed to https://reside-ic.github.io/naomi-news

## Install hugo

This needs a recentish version of hugo (at least 0.83), which might not get on with the current reside blog. The version in apt is probably too old, but snap works (`sudo snap install hugo --channel=extended`)

## Download source

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:reside-ic/naomi-news
```

## Create a new post

```
hugo new posts/<title>
```

This will create a .md file in `content/posts` which you should edit.

The front matter options that might be useful:

```
---
title: "Add a title here"
date: 2022-10-20T13:51:48+01:00
tags: ["release"]

hideSummary: false # set this to true to prevent the summary
summary: "A string here" # set this to force the summary content
---
```

## Develop

```
hugo serve
```

Visit http://localhost:1313/naomi-news/ to see changes, editing the file will reflect immediately
