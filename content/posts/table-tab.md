We are proud to release a new tab to the model outputs page. This can be accessed from "Model Outputs" page under the "Table" tab.

The table tab lets you filter and pivot the data by selecting our presets which currently contain "Sex by area" and "Sex by 5 year age groups". There are some filters baked into the table itself to let you search a particular age group or district. You can also download a smaller slice of the data by using the "Download filtered data" at the bottom. Please note that the data that is downloaded does not filter based on the filters baked into the table - we only filter that data based on our filters on the left hand side.
