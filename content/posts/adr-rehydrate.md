We've added a new feature to allow you to import an output zip from the ADR. Clicking this will list all datasets in the ADR you have access to which have an output zip. It will list datasets from this years estimates and last years, so you can use this to review last years approved estimates. 

To import an output zip, log in and go to the project page and click the "New" button to find the "Import output ZIP from ADR" option.
