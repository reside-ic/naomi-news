We're pleased to announce an update to Naomi that allows you to upload the DMPPT2 workbook tool into Naomi on the model inputs page. If you upload this file, Naomi will extract VMMC indicators and add them into the PEPFAR datapack file included in the Naomi output zip.

Previously, users had to download their output from Naomi, upload it to Spectrum, wait for the VMMC indicators to be added, and then download the updated file. Now, this process is simplified. By uploading the DMPPT2 workbook directly into Naomi, you bypass the need to upload your results into Spectrum.
