A model output zip can now be reloaded into the app to allow users to review the output plots, see the options used and review the input data.

The new feature can be accessed from the "File" menu in the top left hand side of the screen from both the model fit and projects page.

This feature will completely restore the project from the outputs, you can use it to share a model output with a collaborator so that they can see the results, see the input data and options used and even refit the model. This is available to guest users too if you want to share your outputs with someone who does not have a Naomi login.

Note this will only work with new model output files.
