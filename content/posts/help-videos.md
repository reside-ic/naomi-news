2 years ago we created some instruction videos about how to use Naomi. We've now added a link from the "Online support" menu in the header to the videos. We've plans to update and expand these video tutorials going forward so stay tuned for updates! You can watch the videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/@naomi-unaids).
