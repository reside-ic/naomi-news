We've released a new model output download, the comparison report.

The report is an html file containing details and interactive plots comparing Naomi estimates to input data. This includes details of the data used in the comparison and interactive plots to explore differences between model outputs and input data. You can share this with people who do not have access to Naomi to give them an overview of model comparisons.
