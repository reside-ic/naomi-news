This can be accessed from the &amp;ldquo;Review output&amp;rdquo; step under a new &amp;ldquo;Comparison&amp;rdquo; tab.
You can use this plot to review differences between input data and model outputs. Using the filters you can select which indicator to visualise and which variable to display on the x-axis. We recommend viewing indicators such HIV prevalence, ART coverage and key ANC indicators by sex and region.</description></item><item><title>Model output zip can now be loaded to view outputs</title><link>https://naomi.unaids.org/news/posts/project-load/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://naomi.unaids.org/news/posts/project-load/</guid><description>A model output zip can now be reloaded into the app to allow users to review the output plots, see the options used and review the input data.

You can access this at https://naomi.unaids.org/explore You can use this new mode to view your input data early in the estimates process within a simplified UI. The data exploration has less strict data validation than the Naomi model fit and so can be used to diagnose data issues before model fitting. The new mode is available to users without a Naomi account via the &amp;ldquo;Continue as guest&amp;rdquo; button on the landing page.</description></item></channel></rss>
