This can be accessed from &amp;ldquo;Model Outputs&amp;rdquo; page under the &amp;ldquo;Table&amp;rdquo; tab.
The table tab lets you filter and pivot the data by selecting our presets which currently contain &amp;ldquo;Sex by area&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Sex by 5 year age groups&amp;rdquo;. There are some filters baked into the table itself to let you search a particular age group or district.</description></item><item><title>Help videos now available</title><link>https://naomi.unaids.org/news/posts/help-videos/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://naomi.unaids.org/news/posts/help-videos/</guid><description>2 years ago we created some instruction videos about how to use Naomi.

You can access this at https://naomi.unaids.org/explore You can use this new mode to view your input data early in the estimates process within a simplified UI. The data exploration has less strict data validation than the Naomi model fit and so can be used to diagnose data issues before model fitting. The new mode is available to users without a Naomi account via the &amp;ldquo;Continue as guest&amp;rdquo; button on the landing page.</description></item></channel></rss>
